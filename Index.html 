        <h1>Based on Sigmund Freud's pyschosexual stage theory, during the phallic stage, age 6 to puberty, you have incestual sexual feelings towards your opposite gender parent. For boys, its called Odeius Complex. For Girls, its called Electra Complex. Additionally, since you like your opposite gender parent, you find the same gender parent as your rival, and thus, you try to copy them, leading to you forming your gender identity.</h1>
